## Overview
This part of the project deals with interfacing between C and C++. This
project also adds a fog of war element. The player has a 3x3 grid "lamp",
and anything outside of the lamp is hidden. However, new modifications
to the same grid will not be revisited. Monsters outside of the lamp are
similarly invisible. 

## Running
To compile and run:  

    make all
    ./bin/rlg327
