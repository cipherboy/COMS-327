## Overview=
This part of the project creates factories and places them into the map city,
allowing the creation of monsters from the factory classes via the
make_widgets() function call. This rolls the specific dice, creating new
instances of the designated types. In particular, the city has two main
factories: monsters and object. As the monsters are rampantly out of control,
the object factory has had to step up, producing over 15 items per map! With
good luck, you can reach the One Ring before the monsters reach you...
