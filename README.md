## Overview
This part of the project finishes the conversion to C++. Since this project has
thus been fully converted, the few remaining structs have been converted to
classes. Finally, the development of an editable EDL, or Entity Description
Language for monsters and objects creates a modable interface to the game.




## Running
To compile and run:  

    make all
    ./bin/rlg327
