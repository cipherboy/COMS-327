## Overview
The goal of this part of the project is to add moving monsters and playing
characters to the game. In particular, there exist four base attributes any
monster could have:

- Intelligence
- Telepathy
- Tunneling
- Erratic Behavior

The probability of having any one of these attributes is 50%. At this stage,
the player's movement is unable to be controlled and simply wanders around
aimlessly. Poor guy, almost certain to die a horrible death...


## Running
To compile and run:  

    make all
    ./bin/rlg327
