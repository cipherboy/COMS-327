## Overview=
This part of the project creates factories and places them into the map city,
allowing the creation of monsters from the factory classes via the
make_widgets() function call. This rolls the specific dice, creating new
instances of the designated types.

## Running
To compile and run:  

    make all
    ./bin/rlg327
